  🎣 Day 2 - useState, useEffect, and Forms 🐟
</h1>

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Give components state, with **useState**, which can be modified by interactive portions of the site
- Ability to run code when the component *mounts*, *unmounts*, or the *state changes*, with **useEffect**
- Accept user input with *input* fields and *buttons*


## 📔 Assignment

Make a quiz app like the project done in lecture (can be referenced in the [live-code](./live-code) folder located in this days curriculum). It must have the following requirements:

- main menu with a title
- game screen where you will play the game
- at least one *input* field somewhere, this can be as the responses to the quiz questions or for something like a leaderboard feature
- custom styling (tailwind recommended)

you can choose whatever you want for the content of the game. Below are some ideas.

- math questions, examples: arithmetic, algebra
- preset trivia questions, exmaples: movies, songs, history
- [stroop effect](https://freebrainagegames.com/stroop.html#), where you type out the color of the text displayed
- [memory game](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/number-memory), where you have to remember a series of numbers after a set amount of time
