</h1>

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Use **Components** to create reusable elements on a webpage
- Apply a function to a list of data, using **map**
- Condense a list of values to a single value, using **reduce**
- Filter a list using the **filter** method


## 📔 Assignment

Download the provided data folder from [here](./assignment-data/), which includes a `json` file containing a list of details for different animals, as well as the images for each animal.

Each animal has the following attributes:
- `type` - animal type
- `state` - emotional expression
- `img` - path to the image
- `adoption_fee` - the cost to adopt the animal

Then do the following, to the list of animals:

1. **filter** a decided attribute out of the list of animals (ex. no lizards, or only costs 20 dollars or less)
2. Use **reduce** to get the total cost of all of the animals, and display it on the page somewhere
3. Then use **map** to display each of the animals in their own **Component**
